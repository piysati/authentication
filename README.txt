This application contains a basic Registration and Login module using Java, SpringBoot. 
In this project we will initialize the SpringBoot application, establish Database connection, implement Data Validation and Regex, compare password from a user saved in database, encrypt the password etc.

To set up the project go to https://start.spring.io/
- Select Dependency Management eg POM
- Select Java & SpringBoot version 
- Add dependencies (lombok, data jpa, mysql connector, spring web, spring security)

Launch the project, and setup the database in application.properties.

Now to enable custom authorization:
First implement HTML, CSS, JS in src/main/resource.
Also add thymeleaf dependency so that Spring Boot will automatically configures a view resolver.
